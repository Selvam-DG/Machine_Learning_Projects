# Life cycle of Data Science
- Identify the problem statement for the value criterion
  - Domain expertise
- Identify sources of data ( primary as well as secondary data sources)
- Pre-process the data for missing data and incorrect data
  - Part 1:
    - Handling missing values and incorrect data
    - Label Encoder, One-hot Encoder, and dummy variables
    - Outlier treatment
    - Feature scaling
    - Handling imbalanced dataset
  - Part 2:
    - Data manipulation, wrangling and cleaning
  - Part 3 :
    - Data Visualisation
      - Tableau, PowerBI
  - Part 4:
    - EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate
- Divide the data into subsets of train and test/validation dataset
- Build analytical models and identify the best model based on the model performance in the validation data
- Implement the solution or decision i.e, Deployment
  - AWS, Azure, Flash
